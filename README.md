## About this page
I'm working on achieving the FreeCodeCamp certificates and creating this Tribute Page is one of the projects towards my goal.
The icon in the upper left corner of my project page (you can click it) is a test bundle from FreeCodeCamp that I must include. It is necessary to prove that the test suite for 'Tribute Page' passes.
