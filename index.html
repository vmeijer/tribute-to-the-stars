                        I wish that everyone will experience something that is beyond the most beautiful words possible.
                        You can feel it with all your heart and soul.
                        You know it is true, and this very truth adds that mysterious touch to your everyday life.
                        For me, it means looking at the stars and realizing we are a part of them and they are a part of us.

                    <h2>Personal friendship with stars</h2>

                    Do you recognize that overwhelming feeling of love? You might not pay attention to stars at all and wonder what is so special about them.
                    The stars are so high above the earth, we can not even touch them. It is fun attempting to put a collection of stars together and create your own <em>constellation</em>.
                    Many people have associated certain groups of stars with tales and ancient mysteries.<br><br>
                    I love thinking about those mysteries.
                    It shows what our ancestors thought about the origins of life.
                    Stars were given a personality and 'starred' (pun intended) in heroic myths and legends.
                    It is remarkable that throughout time, people came up with the same questions.
                    Where in the universe are more forms of life?
                    What are we made of?
                    Where are we coming from?
                    Where are we going to?
                    How will we evolve as human race?
                    A simple, yet introspective look at the stars can invoke so many questions and feelings.

                        <h2>One life can make a difference</h2>

                        Inside stars occur various chemical reactions. The result is light and heat in certain degrees, depending on the star.<br><br>
                        <em>
                            <strong>
                                It is exactly this result that makes life possible for us on earth. Thanks to our sun, our star.
                                <br><br>
                            </strong>
                        </em>
                        Isn't that amazing? One star, one in this vast universe is enough to influence our entire earth where we, mortals, live.
